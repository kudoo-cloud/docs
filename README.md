# Tokenomics

## Distribution of KUD

* 10% under the Pangolin Labs
* 30% to Team/Treasury
* 10% to Private Sale
* 10% Airdropped to DAO's
* 40% Community distributed

### Pangolin Labs

Pangolin Labs is an incubator which has allowed Kudoo to develop into a fully fledged product. While Kudoo has been in development for years, Pangolin allowed the resources to get it working for the Blockchain and allowed us the platform to get our product to market. We will release 48,200 KUD tokens over 1 year to the following Pangolin pools:

* PNG - WAVAX
* Single sided PNG staking
* USDC.e - KUD

### Team/Treasury

30% of the token allocation will be used to fund the further development of the protocol

### Private Sale

Since there are approximately 482,000 Kudu that exist in the wild that's how many tokens we will release.

We will release KUD with a fully diluted valuation of 10 million USD at a price of $20.75 per token.

This sale will consist of two rounds. 

* Private sale
* Avalaunch sale

### Airdrop

We will airdrop to DAO's on Avalanche. The current thinking is that the following projects will be eligible:

* Yield Yak

* Sherpa
* Spore
* Elk
* Markr
* Canary
* Trader Joe
* Lydia
* Avalaunch
* Husky
* Baguette
* Cycle
* Crypto Seals
* Gondola

### Community distributed

We'll distribute the rest of KUD via a variety of distribution methods, including staking. 20% of the total supply will be set aside for Olympus PRO for the Pangolin LP pool of USDC.e - KUD

## Revenue model

Kudoo will charge users for performing actions within the dApp. These transactions will be charged in USDC.e to prevent volatility. The USDC will then be in a smart contract, which will periodically purchase back KUD on the open market. 

The current thinking is the following actions will be charged:

* Submitting a timesheet will be charged at 10c
* Submitting a Payrun will be charged at $10
* Treasury management will be charged at 0.3% per annum on a weekly revaluation period
